# sf_bike_project

Project done using POSTGRESQL and mode analaytics database 

[modeanalytics.sf_bike_share_station , modeanalytics.sf_bike_share_trip , modeanalytics.sf_weather]

1.	For each year in the dataset, how long did the longest trip beginning during that year take to complete? Do these numbers seem reasonable? For each year, what was the average trip duration? Please include units of measurement in your answer.

2.	Did any trips occur before the start station first opened?

3.	What is the relationship between the number of docks and the number of trips that depart each station? Would you use this information to adjust the number of docks at each station? Can you think of any other relevant information you would need to make this decision?

4.	Is there less demand for bikes on rainy days at start station San Francisco Caltrain (Townsend at 4th)?

5.	Is the data provided “clean”? Why or why not?

6.	Ask yourself an interesting question about this data set, answer it, and tell us about it!
